I made a change

I notice lots of differences when changing the program from 3.9 to 2.0. I also changed the loop from 10 to 20, as the directions asked.



This was my results after making these changes. Notice that the numbers are looped 20 times instead of 10, and the integers changed compared to the 3.9 program.
